# Officials-for-Inputted-NBA-Game
This program allows for one to pass in the home team name, the away team name, and the date of the game to receive the specific officials for that game.

This was inspired by the fact that many NBA chat-bots aren't able to give back referee information on games. As a result, I implemented my own program to do so.
